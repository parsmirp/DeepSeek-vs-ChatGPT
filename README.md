# DeepSeek-vs-ChatGPT
This is a text mining project that explores potential biases in AI chatbots, specifically ChatGPT and DeepSeek, as they become more popular than traditional search engines.
The study aims to compare how these models present historical narratives, particularly concerning the United States, China, and their interactions.
By analyzing responses to questions about post-World War II history and global issues,
the project seeks to determine if the chatbots exhibit biases favoring their countries of origin.
